It forms a key part of the Gaiwan success formula. By constantly researching deep technical topics and making them easily digestible we build up a knowledge and expertise in-house, which directly improves our client work.</p></article><article><header><h3>Lambda Island Open Source</h3></header><p>All Gaiwan engineers are active open source contributors, and we have several open source libraries we created and maintain, available through the <a href="https://github.com/lambdaisland">Lambda Island</a> brand.</p><p>These projects often stem from needs we saw in client projects, or in the community in general. By opening them up we make sure we can use these building blocks on subsequent projects.
